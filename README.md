# hello-world

Hi everyone,

I'm a Program, Data, and Reporting Analyst at TEC Solutions in Washington, DC. I have an Ecomonics degree from George Mason University and am extremely passionate about pursuing a career in Data Science. I have the foundational skills of a Data Analyst, but I want to keep pushing. Who knows? Maybe I'll end up being a professor. Alternatively, I could start my own company. What if I build a career doing freelance work? The possibilities are endless, and that's what I (and we all, I think) love about this community. 

Here's to a love of data and an endless curiosity about the world!!
